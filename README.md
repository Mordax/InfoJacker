# InfoJacker
A Cyberpunk, Text-based, quasi-historical RPG built in React Native.

To run, you need Node installed. Clone this repo and run `npm start`. View it in the Expo App for now.

> For personal development purposes - 

If running into a wall running on expo, try `exp start --tunnel` to make sure the ipv4 config isn't tripping up.

Made for Github's [GameOff 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018). Expo link [here](https://expo.io/@mordax/infojacker). 

Gigantic work in progress due to the development environment constantly breaking on me. Logo is accidentally unseeable, will be fixed later.

Tried to modify the assets as much as I could (and they will probably be changed later), but photo/picture credits go to Liam Reid and Greg Girard for the bedroom picture and Kowloon Walled City photos respectively.

`Current version:` Super alpha pre-release 0.1.0.
